[Tesla Motors in Europe: a visualization of quarterly sales figures](https://bl.ocks.org/EricPerbos/raw/3c11acdcc679694bd6ba6c822dbdc0ef)

## Summary
Tesla Motors is a North American car company that designs, manufactures and sells electric vehicles all over the world (Wikipedia).

Providing an explicit picture of its European sales though one chart is intricate as countries vary widely in terms of absolute sales (from 25 to 2500 in a quarter), making a bar chart inadequate as one leading country will "dwarf" smaller ones in scale.

After initial research, we opted for circle's area as representation of sales.

After feedback, we added a small bar chart to show the "Sales per million of habitants" to show the local performance of each country marketwise.
